## DICEWARE GENERATOR

This is the source code of the [diceware generator](https://diceware.vercel.app) website. People can use it to generate secure passphrases using the diceware method. The idea is to generate sequences of numbers via dice rolls that serve as keys in a dictionary full of words. The generated words then form a secure and relatively easily memorizable passphrase.
